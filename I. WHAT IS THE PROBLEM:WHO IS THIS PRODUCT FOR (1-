I. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM/WHO IS THIS PRODUCT FOR (1-2 slides?)
    are you:
        troubled by a cell phone addiction?
        distracted or struggling to pay attention?
        worried about privacy?
        interested in being near ambient light sources? 
        low on phone battery?

 		PRESENTING CELL PHONE WALL 

II. HOW DOES IT WORK? 
    A) ~just one easy step~ show 'instructions for cell phone users' slide
    B) ~revolutionary~ a lot of products cut out middleman, we added one: the attendant [screenshot seeking attendant / seeking attendant]
    C) ~complexity is good/more is more~ after our open-source proprietary facial detection software identifies an attendant, triggering an automated markov-chain-generated from hand-sourced blogs and articles about saving phone battery [screenshot of one of the articles? screenshot of phone receiving notification]
    D) ~TBD:it's up to you (the attendant)~ once the attendant's presence triggers the phones to light up with notifications, the attendant can 
    	a) look at each phone to check the battery level and charge phones where needed, using chargers provided
    	b) read people's notifications as they please
    	c) enjoy our sculpture 


III. CONCEPTION OF IDEA (1 slide) -- KOVACS
    trends like phone stacking, nightclubs, and teachers being pissed in class (images)
    + 
    conspicuously keeping your phone charged, -- sharing + publicizing a ritual that's usually private (images)
    = 
    Cell Phone Wall (gestire)


IV. PROBLEMS: SOLVED -- JENNY
	distraction is no longer an issue because everyone’s phones will be on the wall lighting up constantly.
    privacy doesn’t matter anymore because everyone can read everyone’s texts.
    don’t worry about batteries bc an attendant is ~always~ taking care of them and there are *two* whole cords.

V. LIVE DEMO - invite audience member to take part (1 slide?)
